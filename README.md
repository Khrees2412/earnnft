# EarnNFT Program - Simple Explanation

## What is this program?

The EarnNFT program is a tool built for the Solana blockchain that lets people create and manage special digital collectibles called NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens). These NFTs are like unique digital items (think of them as rare trading cards or digital art) that can be locked for a certain time and have rules about how they can be sold or traded.

### This program makes it easy to:

-   Create a group (or "collection") of NFTs.
-   Add new NFTs to that collection with specific rules, like being "locked" so they can't be traded right away.
-   Set up fees (called royalties) that the creator gets when the NFTs are sold.
-   Unlock the NFTs after a set time, allowing them to be traded freely with updated fees.

## Why would someone use it?

Imagine you're an artist or a game creator who wants to release special digital items. You want to control when people can trade them and ensure you get a percentage of every sale. This program helps you do that by:

-   Creating a Collection: You can set up a group of NFTs with a name and a link to more details (like a webpage with pictures or descriptions).
-   Minting NFTs: You can create new NFTs in that collection. These NFTs start "locked," meaning no one can trade them yet, and you decide how much royalty you get when they're sold.
-   Setting a Timer: You choose a future date when the NFTs can be "unlocked," allowing trading. You can also set different royalty fees for before and after this date.
-   Adding Features Later: If you want to add new rules or features to an NFT (like changing how royalties work), you can do that too.

This is great for creators who want to release limited-edition digital items, control their availability, and earn money from future sales.

## How does it work?

Here’s a step-by-step look at what the program does, explained in plain language:

1. Create a Collection: You give the collection a name and a link to more info (like a website). You set a "lock" date (when NFTs can be traded) and two royalty percentages: one for before the lock date and one for after. The program saves this info securely on the Solana blockchain.

2. Mint a Locked NFT: You create a new NFT in the collection with its own name and link. The NFT is automatically "locked" (can’t be traded yet) and has a royalty fee based on the "before lock" percentage you set. Only you (the creator) control when it unlocks.

3. Unlock an NFT: After the lock date you set, you can unlock the NFT. This lets people trade it freely, and the royalty fee switches to the "after lock" percentage. For example, you might set a high royalty (like 10%) before the unlock date and a lower one (like 5%) after.

4. Add New Features: If you want to change or add new rules to an NFT (like updating royalties or adding other features), the program lets you do that.

## Key Features
